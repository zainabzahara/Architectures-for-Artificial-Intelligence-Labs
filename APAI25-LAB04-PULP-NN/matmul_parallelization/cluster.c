/* TASK 1.2: Parallelizazion technique with 8 cores
 *
 * Change the size of the rows of matrix A and see what happens.
 * To parallelize the task, you need to create small chunks to
 * assign to each core. The matrix multiplication kernel splits the
 * task along the matrix A rows accordingly with the number of cores
 * involved.
 * 
 * 1.2.1: Fill the table with the MACs/cycle with 8 cores execution varying
 * the the row size with 4 and 8. Is the parallelization good enough?
 * Amdhal's law can help you answer.
 * What about if you set 80 and 81? What do you expect? Fill the table.
 * 
 * 1.2.2: The IPC (instruction per cycle) is a good metric to see the
 * efficiency of your code, and the ideal value is 1.
 * Calculate the IPC as:
 * 
 *                                 N_EXECUTED_INSNS
 *                       IPC = -----------------------
 *                                 N_TOTAL_CYCLES
 * 
 * What is yours? Fill the table with the performance from each core
 * to see what is happening.
 * You have the pool of performance counters in each core, and they are
 * already used in this code, but only the core 0 is printing them on the terminal.
 * to analyze the performance.

  /* TASK 1.3: Performance analysis
   *
   * Set again the row size equal to 32.
   * The IPC is not higher enough! Your code does not fit perfectly
   * the underlying architecture. What is happening?
   * The pattern:
   * 
   * lw A, off(B)
   * lw C, off(D)
   * mac A, C, Z   <- load stall
   * 
   * generates a load stall each iteration. This is an intrinsic effect
   * of the core pipeline and memory control unit, and you must know it
   * to produce optimal code. In fact, in this case, the load has
   * 1 cycle of latency. This means that you can not use the data loaded
   * from memory (lw instruction) the next clock cycle. The core,
   * before computing the mac instruction, needs to stall the pipeline
   * waiting for the valid signal from the memory, telling it that now
   * operand C is ready. The effect is the incrementing of the
   * cycles counter but not of the instructions counter, degrading
   * the overall IPC.
   * The PULP core has a dedicated performance counter to count the number
   * of load stalls. Activate it on each core to evaluate the effect
   * of the pipeline on your code.
   * 
   * 1.3.1: Fill the table with the total number of load stalls
   * with 8 cores.

   * the workload among multiple processing units with respect
   * to execute it sequentially.

   * number of cores with 2, 4, and 8 and compute the speed-up
   * for each iteration. Is it equal to the maximum achievable?

   * 
   *                  1
   * SU(N) = -------------------, p <= 1, N = available cores

   *  - p is the part of the code that ca be parallelized
   *  - 1-p is the part of the code that can not be parallelized
   *  - N is the number of cores
